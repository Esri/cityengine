Street Segment Favela Example Instructions

Guide:

1. Call "File | Set Project..." and set it to the downloaded Street Segment Maya project (otherwise Serlio will not find the required rule packages).

2. Open one of the four provided Maya scenes, this will immediately trigger the generation of the building models - it might take a while to load the scene after starting Maya.
