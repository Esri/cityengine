introduction: This extension allows users to create 3D models in SketchUp using CityEngine's procedural modelling technology.<p>The extension generates a 3D model from a shape drawn in SketchUp. Some rule packages require a 2D start shape, such as a rule that extrudes and textures a building footprint. Other rule packages may need a 3D form as the initial shape, such as a rule that adds balconies and awnings to a building massing. Once the start shape is drawn and the user clicks "Generate", CityEngine's procedural modelling is applied. You can modify the attributes of the rule package, such as the textures to use when modelling a building, in the extension's user interface before you generate the model.  You can use existing CityEngine rule packages, or ones that you've created yourself in CityEngine in the extension.</p><p>The CityEngine SketchUp Extension was created by the <b>Education and Research Group at Esri Canada</b></p><i>The CityEngine SketchUp Extension is free for personal, educational, and non-commercial use. Commercial use requires at least one commercial license of the latest CityEngine version installed in the organization. Redistribution or web service offerings are not allowed unless expressly permitted.</i>

  - title: 3D City Model Site
    text: The extension includes several sample rule packages. More rules can be downloaded from the 3D City Model Site, a free resource for creating 3D city models. The first section of the website, <a href="https://3dcitymodels.esri.ca/#collection" target="_blank">CGA Rules</a>, contains a collection of rule packages with links to preview (demo) the rule in your browser using the <a href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/about-cityengine-web-viewer.htm" target="_blank">CityEngine Web Viewer</a> and to download the rule package from ArcGIS Online.</p><p>Some of the rules contain a “View Code” link which will open a text editor in your browser with the CGA code of the rule. Clicking on keywords in the code will open the associated CityEngine documentation to help understand how the rule works.</p>
