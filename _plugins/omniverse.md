description: The Omniverse Connector is a plugin for CityEngine itself. It allows users to conveniently send 3d city models to an Omniverse server for simulation, collaboration and high-end visualization. The Connector supports lightweight iteration on individual city parts by non-destructively updating previous exports.

introduction: The Omniverse Connector for CityEngine provides an uni-directional link to Omniverse Nucleus. On top of the basic export functionality, repeated exports with the same name will accumulate using USD composition techniques. This allows for convenient tweaking of an exported model (e.g. updating a single building in a large city) without having to re-run full exports (which are potentially time-consuming).
