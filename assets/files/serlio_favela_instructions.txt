Serlio Favela Example Instructions

Guide:

1. Call "File | Set Project..." and set it to the downloaded Favela Maya project (otherwise Serlio will not find the Favela RPK).

2. Open one of the two provided Maya scenes, this will immediately trigger the generation of the Favela model - it might take a while to load the scene after starting Maya.
