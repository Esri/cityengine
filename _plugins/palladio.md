description: Serlio is well suited for managing the procedural generation of architectural 3D content in digital sets. However, Serlio is restricted to the procedural generation of single buildings / objects. Serlio does not include the city layouting and street network editing tools of CityEngine i.e. the rich CityEngine toolset to design a city from scratch (or based on geographic data) is still needed. Serlio is free for non-commercial use. Commercial use requires at least one commercial license of the latest CityEngine version installed in the organization. No redistribution is allowed. Please refer to the licensing section below for more detailed licensing information.
