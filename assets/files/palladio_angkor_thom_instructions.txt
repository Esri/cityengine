Palladio Instructions:

The scene consists of three major steps:

1. The "/obj/PALLADIO_BASE" geometry node generates the various CityEngine Rules via Palladio and assigns them to multiple outputs.
2. Multiple "/obj/process_palladio_xxx" nodes reference above outputs, apply a stone weathering effect and cache out the geometry.
3. The "/obj/creepers_xxx" nodes apply some creeper plant effects.

How to change one of the rule attribute values:

1. Activate the "render" flag of the "OUT_columnRowWithBeams" node in PALLADIO_BASE.
2. Find "attribcreate3" above the out node and change the value of "Total_Height", the model will regenerate.
3. Go to "process_palladio_columnRowWithBeams" and render "file1", will take a while.
4. Set the "render" flag back to "uvtransform1" and click "reload geometry" on "file2"."
5. Repeat the previous step for the file nodes in "creepers_columnRowWithBeams".
